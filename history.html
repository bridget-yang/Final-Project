        <p>Did you know that the first computer programmer was actually a woman? This is shocking to many as in 2015, only 18% of computer science degrees were earned by women; that percentage is even lower for women of color. The first computer program was written by a woman named Ada Lovelace (1815-1852). Lovelace’s mother, Lady Byron, had mathematical training and insisted that Lovelace did too which was very unusual for women to do at the time. In 1833, Lovelace met Charles Babbage, the creator of the first computer, and was deeply inspired by his invention, the Difference Engine, which was essentially an automatic calculator. In 1843, Lovelace published a translation of a French paper about the Analytical Engine, Babbage’s latest invention at the time, that was written by an Italian mathematician. She also added her own notes to the paper. In these notes, she wrote a sequence of operations for calculating Bernoulli numbers; this became known as the first computer program. Moreover, Ada speculated that the Analytical Engine could be used to do operations on things other than numbers; she predicted that it could also be used to compose music. This revelation was way ahead of its time, just like Lovelace. She defied the gender norms of the time by proving that women can perform more than just domestic roles; they can also develop computer programs.</p>

            Have you watched the movie Hidden Figures? If you haven’t, well you should, but if you did, do you know that Taraji P. Henson’s character was based on Katherine Johnson? Katherine Johnson was a brilliant mathematician who calculated the flight paths of many spacecrafts at NASA; she helped send astronauts to the moon! She also skipped multiple grades and was chosen to integrate West Virginia’s graduate schools along with two African American male students. In 1953, Johnson began working at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics’s West Area Computing unit, a group of African American women known as the West Computers who manually solved complex mathematical calculations for NACA’s engineers. These women’s calculations were crucial to the success of the early U.S. space program. At the time, NACA was segregated, so the West Computers were not allowed to use the same bathrooms and eat at the same cafeterias as their white co-workers. In 1958, NACA was integrated into  National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and NASA thankfully banned segregation. At NASA, Katherine worked in the Space Task Group. In 1960, she wrote a paper with Ted Skopinski, one of the group’s engineers, about the calculations for placing a spacecraft into orbit. This was the first time a woman in her division was recognized as an author of a research report. Despite all the hardships she endured because of her gender and race, Katherine Johnson authored/co-authored a total of 26 research papers.
