    </h1>
    <p class = karlieInfoOne> is a supermodel and entrepreneur. One of her projects made was Kode With Klossy, a girl's coding camp that teaches web and app development. Since we are scholars of Kode With Klossy, we were able to get in contact with her and ask a question. </p>
    <p class = karlieInfoQ> Why should people learn how to code? </p>
    <p class = karlieInfoA> - I think everyone should learn how to code because it's important to understand the world around us and coding is the future! </p>

    </h2>
      <p class = crystalInfoBio> is an incoming freshmen studying Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. She was a teacher assistant for Kode With Klossy LA 2019.
      <p class = crystalInfoQ1> What got you interested in your chosen STEM field? / What got you interested in coding? </p>
      <p class = crystalInfoA1> - I became interested in computer science after taking AP Computer Science, a programming course that my high school offered. I really enjoyed the course because it requires a lot of problem solving, and it challenged me in ways that no other subject had. </p>
      <p class = crystalInfoQ2> How did you learn to code? </p>
      <p class = crystalInfoA2> - I learned to code through my high school’s AP Computer Science classes, as well as through a program called Kode With Klossy. Both taught me so much about back-end programming and front-end web development and I still enjoy doing both to this day.  </p>
      <p class = crystalInfoQ3> Do you have any advice for young girls who are interested in entering your field? </p>
      <p class = crystalInfoA3> - I would advise young girls to not be discouraged by the gender gap in STEM/computer science, but rather see it as a challenge that it’s their mission to overcome. I would also encourage young girls to join programs such as Kode With Klossy or Girls Who Code where they can learn among other girls as I did to gain more confidence in a comfortable environment. </p>

      </h2>
      <p class = kaylenInfoBio> is an incoming freshmen studying Computer Science at the University of California, Los Angeles. She participated as a teacher assistant for Kode With Klossy LA 2019.</p>
      <p class = kaylenInfoQ1> What got you interested in your chosen STEM field? / What got you interested in coding? </p>
      <p class = kaylenInfoA1> - I took an Intro to Programming class in 10th grade at my school. I enjoyed the problem-solving aspect of the class and the logical manner in which everything was done. </p>
      <p class = kaylenInfoQ2> How did you learn to code? </p>
      <p class = kaylenInfoA2> - I learned to code through the computer science classes offered at my school, as well as through summer programs. The summer before my junior year, I attended the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program the summer before my junior year and Kode With Klossy the summer before my senior year. </p>
      <p class = kaylenInfoQ3> Do you have any advice for young girls who are interested in entering your field? </p>
      <p class = kaylenInfoA3> - I think it’s really important for girls to have exposure to the fields that they’re interested in. There are so many free resources that they should apply to, such as Girls Who Code and Kode With Klossy. There are also many online courses, such as Code Academy and Free Code Camp, that are very accessible and informative. </p>
